# Minesweeper

In this assignment we communicated with a back-end API server to create the user-interface for a Minesweeper game clone. I created a React app using the API and created the basic game logic. I had a lot of fun re-designing the Minesweeper game and giving it a new title and theme, "Sailor Moonsweeper". My inspiraton for Sailor Moonsweeper was based around a character called Sailor Moon.
